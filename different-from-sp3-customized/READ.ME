this directory contains classes which are different according to BeyondCompare tool's binary compatibility test from SP3-interchange/corelib/openjpa-2.1.1-CUSTOMIZED.jar;
I have decompiled these classes from that jar and from jar produced by running mvn clean install -DskipTests=true in branches/2.1.1 directory.
the diff files show the differences between them;
