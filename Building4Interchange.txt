PLEASE SEE NOTE BELOW; the manual building of this project can still be done, but deployment to maven repository is now done as a final step of jenkins job: 3rd_party_customized_openjpa-2.1.1

1) Make your modifications to the applicable source files
2) Run OpenJPA Parent POM -> clean
3) Run OpenJPA Parent POM -> package (you probably want to skip tests)
4) copy ./openjpa/target/openjpa-2.1.1-CUSTOMIZED.jar to Interchange/corelib
5) Check in changes as normal.

Seby noticed that com.axway.interchange:openjpa-2.1.1-CUSTOMIZED.jar in artifactory does not contain latest code changes Craig Petty did to PreparedQueryImpl.java. This is the jar used to build interchange 6.0 and 5.12 SP4.

When I have built openjpa jar from branches/2.1.1 sources, we've noticed that there were number of classes were different from openjpa-2.1.1-CUSTOMIZED.jar in 5.12 SP3 branch. Also, looking at the dates of the classes in CUSTOMIZED jar, all but one are dated 5/6/2014 while branches/2.1.1 sources here were added June 30th, 2014, which would support the hypothesis that openjpa-2.1.1-CUSTOMIZED.jar in SP3 was never built from sources in branches/2.1.1;

Since deploying of a single jar is strongly discouraged by company policy, we've opted to create 3rd_party_customized_openjpa-2.1.1 job and build and deploy this project that way.
PLEASE NOTE:
there is an extra directory: 'different-from-sp3-customized' listing all classes different between the current project and what was used in SP3 along with diff files showing the differences
